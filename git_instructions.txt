commands I used to setup github:

after installing gitbash, the below commands are useful

git --version

touch filename

git add filename

git commit -m "-m means add a comment while commiting"

git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"

below command will help you to link your local files to your github repository:


git add remote origin https://github.com/subashnalam/devops_instructions.git

below command will help you to add the files from local files to github repository for the first time

git push origin master

below command will help you to pull the letest file to local repository:

git pull

before you edit any file do the git pull in your local repository

once you edited/modified a file make sure add the file first

--- git add git_instructions.txt

then commit with proper comments

---- git commit -m "new git instructions are added"

once commited make sure you pushed the files

---- git push
