used below command to install docker in Azure ubuntu VM:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

while installing Docker got the below error
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.26/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.

solution:

Run this command in your favourite shell and then completely log out of your account and log back in (or exit your SSH session and reconnect, if in doubt, reboot the computer you are trying to run docker on!):

sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
